### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am team lead of the [Research Engineering](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/research-engineering/) team,
part of [Research Data Management Support](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management) at Utrecht University.

Together with my team I support researchers at Utrecht University in applying digital technologies in their research.
We also help them making their data and software accessible and reusable, in line with the Open Science and FAIR principles.
**By doing so, we increase the impact of their important work.**

I obtained my masters degrees in biology and environmental sience at Wageningen University. After my graduation I worked for the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. In 2017 I optained my PhD degree in computer science at VU University on the subject of knowledge engineering and linked data. Afterwards, I worked as a research engineer at the Netherlands eSciencecenter. I joined the Research Engineering team at Utrecht University in March 2019.
